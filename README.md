My name is Michelle :) <br>
After I successfully completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Game Art and 3D Animation I decided to take my career in a new direction. <br>
My passion for creating virtual worlds took me deep into the fascinating world of programming. <br>
That is why I started a further education to become a Java programmer. <br>
My unique journey reflects adaptability, resilience and a passion for technology.
